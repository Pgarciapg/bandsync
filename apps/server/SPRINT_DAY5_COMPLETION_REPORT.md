### 6. ✅ Error Handling & Reconnection Logic
**Implementation**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- **Event Validation**: Schema-based event validation with rate limiting
- **Network Recovery**: Exponential backoff reconnection logic
- **Drift Correction**: Automatic sync drift detection and correction

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Multi-User Test Results (6 Clients)
```
🎵 BandSync Multi-User Test Results
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📈 Server Health:
   Status: healthy
   Mode: basic (fallback mode for testing without Redis)
   Active Sessions: 2
   Peak Connections: 7
   Uptime: 94s

👥 Client Performance:
   Client 0: RTT=1.2ms, Sync=1.3ms (Disconnected leader)
   Client 1: RTT=1ms, Sync=1.4ms (New leader elected)
   Client 2: RTT=0.8ms, Sync=1.6ms
   Client 3: RTT=1ms, Sync=1.8ms  
   Client 4: RTT=1ms, Sync=1.9ms
   Client 5: RTT=1ms, Sync=1.9ms

🏁 Summary:
   Total Test Duration: 14s
   Connected Clients: 5/6 (1 intentionally disconnected)
   Average RTT: 1.0ms
