### 3. Connection Quality Warnings
- **Real-time quality monitoring** with threshold detection
- **Visual warnings** for poor connection quality
- **Animated alerts** with fade-in/fade-out transitions
- **Haptic feedback** for connection state changes

### 4. Offline Mode Graceful Degradation
- **Session state caching** for 5-minute duration
- **Network state monitoring** using @react-native-community/netinfo
- **Offline mode indicators** with cached data timestamps
- **Graceful fallback** when network is unavailable

### 5. Heartbeat Monitoring System
- **5-second heartbeat intervals** for connection health monitoring
- **10-second timeout detection** for unresponsive connections
- **Server-client heartbeat** bidirectional communication
- **Health status indicators**: Healthy, Checking, Timeout, Disconnected

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Connection Quality Thresholds
```javascript
const CONNECTION_QUALITY_THRESHOLDS = {
  excellent: 50,   // < 50ms
  good: 100,      // 50-100ms  
  poor: 300,      // 100-300ms
  bad: Infinity   // > 300ms
};
```

### Exponential Backoff Configuration
```javascript
const RECONNECT_INTERVALS = [1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 30000]; // Max 30s
```

### Haptic Feedback Integration
- Network lost: Error vibration
- Network restored: Success vibration  
- Poor connection: Heavy impact
- Manual reconnect: Medium impact

### Advanced Features
- **Compact and expanded views** for different UI contexts
- **Animated transitions** with smooth fade effects
- **Pulse animations** during reconnection attempts
- **Touch-to-expand** detailed metrics view
- **Comprehensive error handling** and edge cases

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Indicators
- **Color-coded status** indicators throughout the interface
- **Icon-based communication** for instant status recognition
- **Progressive disclosure** with expandable detailed metrics
- **Contextual information** showing network type and capabilities

### Responsive Design
- **Compact mode** for minimal space usage in controls
- **Full mode** for comprehensive status display
- **Adaptive layouts** based on connection state
- **Accessibility considerations** with proper color contrast

### Animation System
- **300ms transition duration** for smooth state changes
- **Pulse animations** for active reconnection states
- **Fade transitions** for warnings and alerts
- **Native driver optimization** for 60fps performance

## üîó Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **useSocket hook integration** - Seamless data flow from socket events
- **SessionScreen components** - Both compact and full-view integration
- **Existing ConnectionStatusIndicator** - Replaced with enhanced version
- **Network status banner** - Coordinates with top-level network alerts

### Backend Coordination
- **Heartbeat events** - `heartbeat` and `heartbeat_response` socket events
- **Latency probes** - Enhanced with connection quality assessment
- **Socket reconnection** - Intelligent retry logic with server coordination

## üì± Mobile-Specific Features

### Platform Integration
- **NetInfo monitoring** - Real-time network state detection
- **Haptic feedback** - Native iOS/Android vibration patterns
- **Background/foreground** - Proper cleanup and resume handling
- **Memory management** - Efficient timeout and interval cleanup

### Performance Optimizations
- **Native driver animations** - Hardware-accelerated transitions
- **Efficient re-renders** - Memoized callbacks and optimized state updates
- **Background cleanup** - Proper disposal of intervals and timeouts
- **Throttled updates** - Prevents UI thrashing during network instability

## üß™ Quality Assurance

### Error Handling
- **Comprehensive try-catch** blocks for network operations
- **Graceful fallbacks** for failed operations
- **User-friendly error messages** with actionable advice
- **Debug logging** for troubleshooting

### Edge Cases Covered

- **App backgrounding/foregrounding** during connection issues
- **Server unavailability** with appropriate user feedback
- **Rapid connection state changes** with debounced updates

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```javascript
<ConnectionStatus
  socket={socket}
  connected={connected}
  connectionStatus={connectionStatus}
  latency={latency}
  syncQuality={syncQuality}

/>
```

### Compact View
```javascript
<ConnectionStatus
  socket={socket}
  connected={connected}
  latency={latency}
  compact={true}
  showReconnectButton={false}
/>
```
