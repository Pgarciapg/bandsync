- **State Consistency**: 100% accuracy across all devices

## Role Switching Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initial Role Assignment Validation

#### Test Case 1.1: First-Join Leadership Opportunity
**Objective**: Validate that first user joining can become leader

**Setup**:
- Clean session state
- Single device (Device A)
- Session ID: `role-init-first-[timestamp]`

**Step-by-Step Procedure**:

1. **Device A Joins Empty Session**
   ```
   Action: Device A joins session
   Expected UI State:
   - Member count: 1
   - Role indicator: None initially
   - "Become Leader" button: Visible and enabled
   - Control buttons: All disabled
   ```
   **Record**: UI state before role assignment

2. **Leadership Request**
   ```
   Action: Device A taps "Become Leader"
   Expected UI Changes (within 200ms):
   - Role indicator: 👑 Crown appears
   - "Become Leader" button: Disappears/disables
   - Tempo controls: Enabled
   - Play/Pause/Stop: Enabled
   - Background color: Subtle leader theme (if applicable)
   ```
   **Measurement**: Time from tap to UI update completion

3. **Server State Validation**
   ```
   Validation Check:
   - Server session shows leaderSocketId = Device A's socket ID
   - Session snapshot broadcast confirms leadership
   - No errors in server logs
   ```
   **Record**: Server response time, state accuracy

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] UI updates within 200ms
- [ ] Server state accurately reflects leadership
- [ ] All leader controls become functional
- [ ] No UI glitches or incorrect states

#### Test Case 1.2: Second User Automatic Follower Assignment
**Objective**: Validate automatic follower role for subsequent joiners

**Setup**: Continue from Test Case 1.1 with Device A as leader

**Step-by-Step Procedure**:

1. **Device B Joins Established Session**
   ```
   Action: Device B joins session with existing leader
   Expected UI State on Device B:
   - Member count: 2
   - Role indicator: 👥 Follower icon appears automatically
   - "Become Leader" button: Visible (can challenge leadership)
   - Control buttons: All disabled/grayed out
   - Leader info: Shows "Device A is the leader" or similar
   ```

2. **Cross-Device State Verification**
   ```
   Device A UI Updates:
   - Member count: 2
   - Maintains 👑 leader status
   - New member appears in member list
   
   Device B UI Validation:
   - Cannot modify tempo
   - Cannot control playback
   - Can view current session state
   - Receives real-time updates from leader
   ```

3. **Permission Enforcement Test**
   ```
   Action: Device B attempts to change tempo (UI should prevent this)
   Expected: Tempo slider disabled/non-responsive
   
   Action: Device B attempts playback control
   Expected: Buttons disabled or show "Leader only" message
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Device B automatically assigned follower role
- [ ] Device B UI correctly shows disabled controls
- [ ] Member count updates on both devices
- [ ] Permission enforcement works at UI level

### Scenario 2: Voluntary Leadership Transitions

#### Test Case 2.1: Seamless Leadership Handoff During Playback
**Objective**: Test role transition without playback interruption

**Setup**:
- 3 devices (A=leader, B&C=followers)
- Active playback at 120 BPM
- Tempo changes and seeking active

**Step-by-Step Procedure**:

1. **Pre-Transition State Recording**
   ```
   Record Current State:
   - Playback position on all devices
   - Current tempo (120 BPM)
   - Beat synchronization status
   - Leader UI state on Device A
   - Follower UI state on Devices B & C
   ```

2. **Initiate Leadership Transfer**
   ```
   Action: Device B taps "Become Leader" during active playback
   
   Expected Sequence (within 500ms total):
   Phase 1 (0-100ms): UI feedback
   - Device B shows "Requesting leadership..." state
   - Device A shows "Leadership transfer..." state
   
   Phase 2 (100-300ms): Server processing
   - Server processes role change request
   - Session state updated with new leader
   
   Phase 3 (300-500ms): UI finalization
   - Device A: 👑 disappears, controls disable, becomes 👥 follower
   - Device B: 👥 becomes 👑, controls enable
   - Device C: Member list updates to show B as leader
   ```

3. **Playback Continuity Validation**
   ```
   Critical Checks:
   - Playback continues without pause or skip
   - Beat synchronization maintained across transition
   - Tempo remains at 120 BPM
   - All devices show consistent playback position
   - No audio glitches or timing artifacts
   ```

4. **New Leader Functionality Test**
   ```
   Action: Device B (new leader) changes tempo to 140 BPM
   Expected: All devices update within 200ms
   
   Action: Device B pauses playback
   Expected: All devices pause simultaneously
   
   Action: Device A attempts tempo change (should fail)
   Expected: UI prevents action, no server request sent
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Leadership transition completes within 500ms
- [ ] Playback continues without interruption
- [ ] Beat sync maintained during transition
- [ ] New leader gains full functionality
- [ ] Previous leader loses control immediately
- [ ] All devices reflect new leadership state

#### Test Case 2.2: Multiple Simultaneous Leadership Requests
**Objective**: Test system behavior with race conditions

**Setup**: 4 devices (A=current leader, B, C, D=followers)

**Step-by-Step Procedure**:

1. **Coordinated Simultaneous Requests**
   ```
   Setup: Prepare devices B, C, D for simultaneous action
   Action: On countdown, all three devices tap "Become Leader" simultaneously
   
   Expected System Behavior:
   - Only ONE device becomes leader (first request processed)
   - Other requests are rejected/ignored
   - Clear feedback provided to rejected devices
   - No split leadership or inconsistent states
   ```

2. **Conflict Resolution Validation**
   ```
   Verify Single Leadership:
   - Only one device shows 👑 crown
   - All other devices show 👥 follower status
   - Server state has exactly one leaderSocketId
   - Member lists consistent across all devices
   
   Rejected Request Handling:
   - Devices with rejected requests show appropriate message
   - UI returns to follower state promptly

   ```
   Setup: Device A is leader, Device B requests leadership
   Action: Simulate network partition during role change request
   
   Scenario Testing:
   - Device B sends "become leader" request
   - Network partition occurs mid-request
   - Test various partition durations (1s, 5s, 10s)
   ```

2. **State Resolution After Reconnection**
   ```
   Expected Outcomes:
   - Leadership state resolves consistently
   - No split-brain scenarios (two leaders)
   - Session state synchronized properly
   - Clear indication of final leadership
   ```

### Scenario 4: Permission Enforcement Validation

#### Test Case 4.1: Comprehensive Permission Matrix Testing
**Objective**: Validate all leader-only actions are properly protected

| Request Leadership | UI Button | Enabled and functional |

**Test Procedure**:

1. **UI-Level Enforcement**
   ```
   For each disabled control on follower device:
   - Verify visual disabled state (grayed out, different opacity)
   - Attempt interaction (should be non-responsive)
   - Check for appropriate user feedback
   - Verify no network requests sent for blocked actions
   ```

2. **Server-Side Validation**
   ```
   For each leader-only action:
   - Manually send socket event from follower (bypass UI)
   - Verify server rejects unauthorized request
   - Check that session state remains unchanged
   - Confirm other devices don't receive invalid updates
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All follower UI controls properly disabled
- [ ] Server rejects unauthorized requests
- [ ] Clear user feedback for disabled actions
- [ ] No security bypasses possible
